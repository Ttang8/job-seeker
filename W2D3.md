## Javascript
- dynamic
- weakly typed
- protoype- based
  - different between classical inheritance
- multi-paradigm
  - function and object oriented
  - singleton
- single-threaded
  - only does one thing at a time
- concurrent
  - capable of delegating multiple tasks
- never blocking
  - interface and output does not interfer with user input

## Is javascript is a good language
- common interview question
- depends on what you are trying to do
  - say what is good about javascript

## parallelism vs concurrency
- multiple things running at the same time
- concurrency - processes can run independently of one antoher, but they do not necessarily run at the same time

- parrallelism - multiple processes can run at exactly the same time

## javascript engine and javascript runtime environment
- web browser is a javascript runtime environemnt
- engine v8

- js engine- interprets your JS code and turns it into runnable commands

- javascript runtime environment- supports your javascript by providing it with common objects and ways to communicate with the world outside your

##JS engine
- Heap
  - memory
- callstack
  -runs top to bottom
##JS runtime environment
- web api
- task queue
  - whatever synchonise object we fed to api
- event loop
  - when call stack is empty, takes stuff from task queue and place in stack queue
  - monitors call stack and task queue
- use js to use web apis and get result
- runs outside of the js engine

## Asynchronicity in js:
- callbacks and promises
- web api

## What is a callback in Javascript
- A function that gets passed in anther function as an argument, which is invoked inside the outer function to complete some kind of routine or action.

## What is a promise in Javascript
- An object that represents the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation
- something that is defined by the run time environment

## Promise.all() and Async/await
- Takes and array of promise objects
- promise.all always takes an array
  - return value is in order
- best for waiting for multiple async calls

## JS run time environemnt
  - thread pool to resolve the promised from promise.all

undefined was the return value of example1
- all synchronous code gets executed first before asynchronous code

## Async await
- async functions return promise objects
- pauses synchronous code

function resolveAfter2seconds(x) {
  return new Promise(resolve => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      resolve(x)
      }, 2000);
    });
}

async function f1() {
  var x = await resolveAfter2seconds(10)
  console.log(x)
}

async function f2() {
  var y = await 20;
  console.log(y);
}

### Temporal Dead Zone
- var, let, const - all three gets hoisted
  - move to the top of the document
  - all is assigned as undefined
  - let and const throw reference errors
  - var returns undefined
  - the time between hoisiting and declaration
