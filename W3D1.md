## Redux

### What is Redux?
- State management
  - One source of state(immutable)
  - Read only
- A predictable state container for Javascript apps.
- uses unidirectional data flow to update a read-only state
- Framework agnostic( don't just have to use with React )

### Redux History
- Created by Dan Abramov and Andrew Clark
- based off of the Flux architecture for application state management
- Was originally a proof of concept for 'time travel' through Flux State
- Open state

## What is state management and why do we need it
- As single page apps are growing, states are getting bigger
- Allows us to organize huge application states
- helps reduce state mutation 'accident'
- coordinates well with asynchronus
- debugging

## Why use redux:
- relatively easy to start writing and using(once you've set up the boilerplate)
- light

## Three principles of redux:
- single source of truth
- state is read only
- changes are made through pure functions

## Pure functions
- no side effects(only thing that happens is the output of the function)
- no outside influence

## What are the three pieces that make up redux
- Store, javascript object
- Actions, tell store to make a change
- Reducers, make the change

### Actions
- payloads of information that send data from your application to the store

### Action Creators
- A function that returns an action
- Used to dynamically assign information to our actions
- Envoked action creators are typically what we pass to store.dispatch()
- do not necessarily need one to make a dispatch call
